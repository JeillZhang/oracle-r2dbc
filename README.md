# About Oracle R2DBC

The Oracle R2DBC Driver is a Java library that supports reactive programming with Oracle Database.

Oracle R2DBC implements the R2DBC Service Provider Interface (SPI) as specified by the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project. The R2DBC SPI exposes Reactive Streams as an abstraction for remote database operations. Reactive Streams is a well defined standard for asynchronous, non-blocking, and back-pressured communication. This standard allows an R2DBC driver to interoperate with other reactive libraries and frameworks, such as Spring, Project Reactor, RxJava, and Akka Streams.

# About This Version
Oracle R2DBC 0.2.0 updates the implemented SPI version to 0.9.0.M1. With the
 0.9.0.M1 SPI update, Oracle R2DBC 0.2.0 introduces support for procedural
  calls (PL/SQL), the ```Statement.bind(...)``` methods are enhanced to accept
   ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter``` objects, and the 
   ```Connection.beginTransaction(TransactionDefintion)``` method is 
    implemented to support named and read-only/read-write transactions.

# Performance Goals
The primary goal of these early releases of Oracle R2DBC is to support the R2DBC
 SPI on Oracle Database. The only performance goal is to enable concurrent
 database calls to be executed by a single thread.

The R2DBC SPI and Oracle's implementation are both pre-production. As these
 projects mature we will shift our development focus from implementing
 the SPI to optimizing the implementation.


# Installation
Oracle R2DBC can be built from source using Maven:

`mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`

> Omitting -DskipTests=true from the command above will execute the test suite, where end-to-end tests connect to an Oracle Database instance. The connection configuration is read from [src/test/resources/config.properties](src/test/resources/example-config.properties).

Artifacts can also be found on Maven Central.
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.oracle.database.r2dbc</groupId>
  <artifactId>oracle-r2dbc</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Oracle R2DBC is compatible with JDK 11 (or newer), and has the following runtime dependencies:
- R2DBC SPI 0.9.0.M1
- Reactive Streams 1.0.3
- Project Reactor 3.0.0
- Oracle JDBC 21.1.0.0 for JDK 11 (ojdbc11.jar)
  - Oracle R2DBC relies on the Oracle JDBC Driver's [Reactive Extensions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/jdbc-reactive-extensions.html#GUID-1C40C43B-3823-4848-8B5A-D2F97A82F79B) APIs. These APIs were introduced in the 21.1 release of Oracle JDBC, and are only available with the JDK 11 build (ojdbc11).

The Oracle R2DBC Driver has been verified with Oracle Database versions 19c and 21c.

# Code Examples

The following code example uses the Oracle R2DBC Driver with Project Reactor's [Mono](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html) and [Flux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html) types to open a database connection and execute a SQL query:
```java
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = ConnectionFactories.get(
  "r2dbc:oracle://db.example.com:1521/db.service.name");

Mono.from(connectionFactory.create())
  .flatMapMany(connection ->
    Flux.from(connection.createStatement(
      "SELECT 'Hello, Oracle' FROM sys.dual")
      .execute())
      .flatMap(result ->
        result.map((row, metadata) -> row.get(0, String.class)))
      .doOnNext(System.out::println)
      .thenMany(connection.close()))
  .subscribe();
```
When executed, the code above will _asynchronously_ print the result of the SQL query.

The next example includes a named parameter marker, ":locale_name", in the SQL command:
```java
Mono.from(connectionFactory.create())
  .flatMapMany(connection ->
    Flux.from(connection.createStatement(
      "SELECT greeting FROM locale WHERE locale_name = :locale_name")
      .bind("locale_name", "France")
      .execute())
      .flatMap(result ->
        result.map((row, metadata) ->
          String.format("%s, Oracle", row.get("greeting", String.class))))
      .doOnNext(System.out::println)
      .thenMany(connection.close()))
  .subscribe();
```
Like the previous example, executing the code above will _asynchronously_ print a greeting message. "France" is set as the bind value for locale_name, so the query should return a greeting like "Bonjour" when row.get("greeting") is called.

# Documentation
This document specifies the behavior of the R2DBC SPI implemented for the 
Oracle Database. This SPI implementation is referred to as the "Oracle R2DBC
Driver" or "Oracle R2DBC" throughout the remainder of this document.

The Oracle R2DBC Driver implements behavior specified by the R2DBC 0.9.0.M1 
[Specification](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M1/spec/html/)
and [Javadoc](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.8.3.RELEASE/api/)

Publisher objects created by Oracle R2DBC implement behavior specified by
the Reactive Streams 1.0.3 [Specification](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md)
and [Javadoc](http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.3-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/package-summary.html)

The R2DBC and Reactive Streams specifications include requirements that are
optional for a compliant implementation. The remainder of this document specifies 
the Oracle R2DBC Driver's implementation of these optional requirements.

### Connection Creation
- The Oracle R2DBC Driver is identified by the name "oracle". The driver 
implements a ConnectionFactoryProvider located by an R2DBC URL identifing
"oracle" as a driver, or by a DRIVER ConnectionFactoryOption with the value
of "oracle".
- The following well-known ConnectionFactory Options are supported: 
DRIVER, USER, PASSWORD, HOST, PORT, DATABASE, SSL, and
CONNECT_TIMEOUT.
- The DATABASE ConnectionFactoryOption is interpreted as the 
[service name](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/netag/identifying-and-accessing-database.html#GUID-153861C1-16AD-41EC-A179-074146B722E6) of an Oracle Database instance. 
System Identifiers (SID) are not recognized.
- A subset of Oracle JDBC's connection properties are supported as extended
Options. For Options having any of the following names, a CharSequence value may be specified:
  - [oracle.net.tns_admin](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html?is-external=true#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_TNS_ADMIN)

- Oracle Net Descriptors of the form ```(DESCRIPTION=...)``` may be specified as an io.r2dbc.spi.Option having the name `oracleNetDescriptor`.
  - If `oracleNetDescriptor` is specified, then it is invalid to specify any other options that might conflict with information in the descriptor, such as: `HOST`, `PORT`, `DATABASE`, and `SSL`.
  - The `oracleNetDescriptor` option may appear in the query section of an R2DBC URL: `r2dbc:oracle://?oracleNetDescriptor=(DESCRIPTION=...)`
  - The `oracleNetDescriptor` option may be provided programatically: `ConnectionFactoryOptions.builder().option(Option.valueOf("oracleNetDescriptor"), "(DESCRIPTION=...)")`
  - The `oracleNetDescriptor` option may be set as the alias of a descriptor in a tnsnames.ora file. The directory of tnsnames.ora may be set using an io.r2dbc.spi.Option having the name `TNS_ADMIN`: `r2dbc:oracle://?oracleNetDescriptor=myAlias&TNS_ADMIN=/path/to/tnsnames/`


### Thread Safety and Parallel Execution
- Oracle R2DBC's ConnectionFactory and ConnectionFactoryProvider are thread safe.
- All other SPI implementations are not thread safe.
- Executing parallel database calls is not supported over a single Connection. 
If a thread attempts to initiate a parallel call, that thread is blocked until
the connection is no longer executing any other call. This is a
limitation of the Oracle Database, which does not support parallel calls
within a single session.

### Reactive Streams
- The Oracle R2DBC javadoc of every method that returns a Publisher specifies the 
behavior of that Publisher in regards to deferred execution and multiple Subscribers.
- Typically, a Publisher of one or zero items defers execution until a Subscriber 
subscribes, supports multiple Subscribers, and caches the result of a database call
(the same result of the same call is emitted to each Subscriber).
- Typically, a Publisher of multiple items defers execution until a Subscriber 
signals demand, and does not support multiple subscribers.

### Errors
- The error code of an R2dbcException is an [Oracle Database 
or Oracle JDBC Driver error message](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/errmg/ORA-00000.html#GUID-27437B7F-F0C3-4F1F-9C6E-6780706FB0F6)

### Transactions
- READ COMMITTED is the default transaction isolation level, and is the
only level supported in this release.
- Transaction savepoints are not supported in this release.
- TransactionDefinition.LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT is not supported in this release.
  - Oracle Database does not support a lock wait timeout that applies to all statements within a transaction.

### Statements
- Batch execution is only supported for DML type SQL commands (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
- SQL commands may contain JDBC style parameter markers where question
mark characters (?) designate unnamed parameters. A numeric index must
be used when setting the bind value of an unnamed parameter.
- SQL commands may contain named parameter markers where the
colon character (:) is followed by an alphanumeric parameter name. A name
or numeric index may be used when setting the bind value of a named parameter.
- Parameter names are case-sensitive.
- When an empty set of column names is specified to Statement.returnGeneratedValues(String...), executing that ```Statement``` returns the [ROWID](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/cncpt/tables-and-table-clusters.html#GUID-0258C4C2-2BF2-445F-B1E1-F282A57A6859) 
of each row affected by an INSERT or UPDATE.
  - This behavior may change in a later release.
  - Programmers are advised not to use the ROWID as if it were a primary key.
    - The ROWID of a row may change.
    - After a row is deleted, its ROWID may be reassigned to a new row.
    - Further Reading: https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/asktom.search?tag=is-it-safe-to-use-rowid-to-locate-a-row
- A **blocking database call** is executed by a Statement returning generated 
values for a non-empty set of column names.
  - The **blocking database call** is a known limitation that will be resolved
  with a non-blocking implementation of 
  java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(String, String[]) in the Oracle JDBC Driver. 
  The Oracle JDBC Team is aware of this problem and is working on a fix.
- Returning generated values is only supported for INSERT and UPDATE commands when a RETURNING INTO clause can be appended to the end of that command. (This limitation may be resolved in a later release)
  - Example: `INSERT INTO my_table(val) VALUES (:val)` is supported because a RETURNING INTO clause may be appended to this command.
  - Example: `INSERT INTO my_table(val) SELECT 1 FROM sys.dual` is not supported because a RETURNING INTO clause may not be appended to this command.
  - The Oracle Database SQL Language Reference defines INSERT and UPDATE commands for which a RETURNING INTO clause is supported.
  - INSERT: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/INSERT.html#GUID-903F8043-0254-4EE9-ACC1-CB8AC0AF3423
  - UPDATE: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/UPDATE.html#GUID-027A462D-379D-4E35-8611-410F3AC8FDA5

### Procedural Calls
- Use ```Connection.createStatement(String)``` to create a
 ```Statement``` that executes a PL/SQL call:
  ```java
  connection.createStatement("BEGIN sayHello(:name_in, :greeting_out); END;")
  ```
- Register out parameters by invoking ```Statement.bind(int/String, Object)```
 with an instance of ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter``` implementing the 
  ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter.Out``` marker interface:
  ```java
  statement.bind("greeting_out", Parameters.out(R2dbcType.VARCHAR))
  ```
- Register in out parameters  by invoking
 ```Statement.bind(int/String, Object)``` with an instance of
  ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter``` implementing both the
   ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter.Out``` and 
   ```io.r2dbc.spi.Parameter.In``` marker interfaces.
- Consume out parameters by invoking
 ```Result.map(BiFunction<Row, RowMetadata>)```:
  ```java
  result.map((row,metadata) -> row.get("greeting_out", String.class))
  ```
- ```Statement.execute()``` returns a ```Publisher<Result>``` that emits one
 ```Result``` for each cursor returned by ```DBMS_SQL.RETURN_RESULT```
    - The order in which a ```Result``` is emitted for a cursor
     corresponds to the order in which the procedure returns each cursor.
    - If a procedure returns cursors and also has out parameters, then the 
    ```Result``` for out parameters is emitted last, after the
    ```Result``` for each returned cursor.

### Type Mappings
- javax.json.JsonObject and oracle.sql.json.OracleJsonObject are supported as 
Java type mappings for JSON column values.
- java.time.Duration is supported as a Java type mapping for INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND 
column values.
- java.time.Period is supported as a Java type mapping for INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH 
column values.
- java.time.LocalDateTime is supported as a Java type mapping for DATE column values.
The Oracle Database type named "DATE" stores the same information as a LocalDateTime:
year, month, day, hour, minute, and  second.

### BLOB, CLOB, and NCLOB
When a SQL query returns a LOB value, a
portion of that value is prefetched from the database and the remaining portion
must be fetched with additional database calls. The number of prefetched
bytes is configured by an ```Option``` named [oracle.jdbc.defaultLobPrefetchSize](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html?is-external=true#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_DEFAULT_LOB_PREFETCH_SIZE)
. The default value of this ```Option``` is 1 GB.
 
The ```Row.get(...)``` method allows LOB values to be mapped into materialized
types like ```ByteBuffer``` and ```String```. If the prefetch size is large
enough to have fetched the entire LOB value, then ```Row.get(...)```  can
return a ```ByteBuffer/String``` without any additional database calls.
Otherwise, if the LOB value is larger than the prefetch size, then
```Row.get(...)```  must execute a **blocking database call** to fetch the
remainder of that value. 

For systems in which LOB values are too large to be prefetched, a smaller
prefetch size can be configured, and LOB values may be mapped into ```Blob```
or ```Clob``` objects rather than ```ByteBuffer``` or ```String```. ```Blob```
and ```Clob``` objects allow the LOB value to be streamed using non-blocking
database calls.

# Secure Programming Guidelines
The following security guidelines should be followed when programming with the Oracle R2DBC Driver.
### Defend Against SQL Injection Attacks
- Always specify the parameters of a SQL command using the bind methods of io.r2dbc.spi.Statement. 
  - Do not use String concatenation to specify parameters of a SQL command. 
  - Do not use format Strings to specify parameters of a SQL command.
### Protect Passwords
- Do not hard code passwords in your source code.
- Avoid hard coding passwords in the R2DBC URL.
  - When handling URL strings in code, be aware that a clear text password may appear in the user info section.
- Use a sensitive io.r2dbc.spi.Option to specify passwords.
  - If possible, specify the Option's value as an instance of java.nio.CharBuffer or java.lang.StringBuffer and clear the contents immediately after ConnectionFactories.get(ConnectionFactoryOptions) has returned. Oracle R2DBC's implementation of ConnectionFactory does not retain a reference to the clear text password.
### Protect Network Communications
- Use SSL/TLS if possible. Use any of the following methods to enable SSL/TLS:
  - Specify the boolean value of true for io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactoryOptions.SSL
  - Specify "r2dbcs:" as the R2DBC URL schema.
  - Specify "ssl=true" in the query section of the R2DBC URL.
- Use Option.sensitiveValueOf(String) when creating an Option that specifies a password.
  - Option.sensitiveValueOf(OracleConnection.CONNECTION_PROPERTY_WALLET_PASSWORD)
    - An SSO wallet does not require a password.
  - Option.sensitiveValueOf(OracleConnection.CONNECTION_PROPERTY_THIN_JAVAX_NET_SSL_KEYSTOREPASSWORD)
  - Option.sensitiveValueOf(OracleConnection.CONNECTION_PROPERTY_THIN_JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTOREPASSWORD)
### Defend Against Denial-of-Service Attacks
- Use a connection pool and configure a maximum size to limit the number of database sessions created by ConnectionFactory.create()
- Enforce a maximum batch size to limit invocations of Statement.add() or Batch.add(String).
- Enforce a maximum fetch size to limit values supplied to Statement.fetchSize(int).
- Enforce a maximum buffer size to limit memory usage when reading Blob and Clob objects.
